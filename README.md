<b>Sounds familiar?</b>

Deglancer helps you <i>learn about your phone usage</i>.

For the first 5 weeks, the app runs a sequence of experiments that provide feedback and helps you think about your phone usage. The application is part of the research, and by using this application you will <b>automatically</b> enroll to the research.

After the research period you can choose what type of feedback you want as you unlock your phone. This information helps you become a more responsible phone user.

<b>What information will this application collect?</b>

This application is part of a research that has been reviewed by the FUAS advisory board on ethics.

The actual research information that this application collects is time stamps when you open and close the phone screen, and whenever you begin or end charging your phone. That's all. This information is enough to conduct the research.

Additionally, this application collects very few elementary pieces of information about your phone (manufacturer, model, Android version, timezone).

You will be assigned a randomly generated identifier. The application does <b>not know</b> your email address, your location, your Google account information or any other information about you.

<b>Further information about the research</b>

The objective of this research is to hypothesize on the effects of behavioural insights. The research also tests whether the use of ‘nudges’ improve awareness to such phone usage that is disturbing and awkward to others. As part of the application functionality, the research tests whether the smartphone usage be improved with these ‘nudges’.

The results of this research can be useful to better understand how non-invasive measures can be introduced to embrace responsible phone usage, and in turn potentially decrease the amount of people that become subject to phone addiction.
